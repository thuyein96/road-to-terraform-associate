Day 5 of Learning Terraform: Understanding Alias



When you start with Terraform, deploying to one region is easy. But as your infrastructure grows, you often need to deploy the same resources across different regions, accounts, or environments.



Instead of copying your code into multiple folders, you can use Aliases.



What is an Alias?

Think of an Alias as a nickname for your provider. It allows you to define multiple configurations for the same provider (like AWS) in a single file.



Why should you use it?

🔷 Multi-Region Management: Manage resources across the globe (e.g., US and Singapore) within a single Terraform configuration.

🔷 Effortless Modularity: Need to change a configuration? Update it in one provider block, and it reflects across all resources using that alias.

🔷 Environment Separation: Easily distinguish between Dev, Test, and Prod instances without messy workarounds.

🔷 Clean Maintenance: Drastically reduces redundancy and human error. One source of truth for your entire infrastructure.



The Scenario:

Let say if you needed to create EC2 instances in both the US and Singapore. By setting a region in the provider and assigning an alias, I could simply set the instances to be in different region.
